<h3>A Flight Management System (FMS) is an on-board multi-purpose navigation, performance, 
    and aircraft operations computer designed to provide virtual data and
     operational harmony between closed and open elements associated with a 
    flight from pre-engine start and take-off, to landing and engine shut-down.</h3><br><br>
